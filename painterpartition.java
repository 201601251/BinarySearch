/*
You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2, A3 â€¦ AN-1}. There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

        2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
        cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
        A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
        configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
        invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003

Input :
K : Number of painters
T : Time taken by painter to paint 1 unit of board
L : A List which will represent length of each board

Output:
     return minimum time to paint all boards % 10000003

Example

Input : 
  K : 2
  T : 5
  L : [1, 10]
